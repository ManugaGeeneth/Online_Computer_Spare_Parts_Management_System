In this project, we developed a web application to streamline the management of computer spare parts in an online environment. The application enables users to browse, add, update, and remove spare parts from the system, along with comprehensive search and retrieval functionalities. All data is securely recorded in a database, ensuring centralized access across the application. This web-based project is implemented following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, utilizing Java as the primary backend language and adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
